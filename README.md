# TE-GNN
Code for paper "Time enhanced graph neural networks for session-based recommendation" in Knowledge-Based System 2022

We have implemented the methods in Pytorch and PyG.

## Usage

`python src/main.py`

## Requirements

```
python==3.7
PyTorch==1.11
numpy==1.21.5
PyG==2.0.4
```

## Note
1. We implement this paper by other dataset.

2. The [author's code](https://github.com/GuTang1997/TE-GNN) does not match the paper's implementation. Therefore, we follow the author's open source code setup.
